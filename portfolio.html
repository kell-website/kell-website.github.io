    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <h2></h2> 
  <p>
In 2010 to 2011 I returned to college after a change in circumstances. I studied entry to construction which consisted of Plumbing, Joinery, Electric, and Painting and decorating.
  </p>
  <p>
Following this course, I completed pre-apprenticeship plumbing after being offered a place on all available pre-apprenticeship course.  </p>
  <p>
In 2015, I took part in the project to restore the corn exchange in Dalkeith, Midlothian. This involved a few weeks in a college classroom learning traditional stone masonry techniques. I learned how to mix and use correctly Lime Mortar. I practiced pointing and ashlar pointing. And how to use Lethomix to repair damaged stone as well as reconstruct damaged walls.  
  </p>
  <p>
This was followed by on-site training at the corn exchange which culminated in fixing a section of wall to make it back to standard.  This was a proud moment as I am now part of the history of the building.  During this I learned how to use new tools and learned new skills to move me forward in my future career.
  </p>
  <p>
I have also learned to use my hands and built a hard case to protect my raspberry pi micro computer with specially customised sockets for the available cables. Using a number of tools I had not used before.
